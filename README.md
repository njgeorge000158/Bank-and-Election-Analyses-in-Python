# Bank and Election Analyses

----

## Bank

----

For this Challenge, I create a Python script, bank_main.py, to analyze one company's profit/loss records for a single year (2023), which are in the CSV file, budget_data.csv, found in the resources folder.  The script calculates each of the following values:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset: 86

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period: $22,564,198

  * The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes: (-8,311.11 USD)

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period: August 16, 2023 (1,862,002.00 USD)

  * The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period: February 14, 2023 (-1,825,558.00 USD)

## Poll

----

For this Challenge, I write a Python script, poll_main.py, to help a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process for a single election: the associated poll data is in a CSV file in the Resources folder, election_data.csv.  The script tallies the votes in the data set and calculates each of the following values:

  * The total number of votes cast: 369,711

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes:

    Charles Casper Stockham

    Diana DeGette

    Raymon Anthony Doane

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won:

    Charles Casper Stockham: 23.05%

    Diana DeGette: 73.81%

    Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.14%

  * The total number of votes each candidate won:

    Charles Casper Stockham: 85,213

    Diana DeGette: 272,892

    Raymon Anthony Doane: 11,606

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote: Diana DeGette

Both programs are versatile and capable of processing other data sets with the same formats: for instance, PyPoll can also handle write-in candidates and announce ties.
